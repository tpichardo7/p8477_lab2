SIR = function (t, state, parameters) {
  with(as.list(c(state, parameters)), {
    dS = -beta * S * (I/N); #rate of change of susceptible population
    dI = beta * S * (I/N) - gamma * I; #rate of change of infectious population
    
    dcumI = beta * S * (I/N) #computing the cumulative number of infections
    
    list(c(dS, dI, dcumI)) #returning the rate of change
  })
}
```

# Part 1: Simulate using the SIR model and check basic model outputs
Read the SIR function and code provided in the script. Then run it with the following conditions and parameters.
N = 1e5
I0 = 10
S0 = N-I0
beta = 0.5
gamma = 0.3
times = seq(1, 100, by = 1)

```{r}
N = 1e5 
I0 = 10 
S0 = N - I0 
state = c(S = S0, I = I0, cumI = I0) 
parameters = c(beta = 0.5, gamma = 0.3) 
times = seq(1, 100, by = 1) 
``` 

```{r}
sim = ode (y = state, times = times, func = SIR, parms = parameters)
```

## Question 1
Based on the simulation, how many people are susceptible on Day 50? How many people are susceptible at the end of simulation?

Based on the simulation, 45,209 people are susceptible on Day 50 and 32,431 are susceptible at the end of the simulation.

## Question 2
Based on the simulation, how many people are infectious on Day 50? How many people are infectious at the end of simulation?

Based on the simulation, 7,164 people are infectious on Day 50 and 11 are infectious at the end of the simulation.

## Question 3
Based on the simulation, how many people have been infected on Day 50? How many people have been infected by the end of simulation?

Based on the simulation, 54,790 people have been infected by Day 50 and 67,568 have been infected by the end of the simulation.

## Question 4
Plot the outputs I and S for each day during the simulated time period.

```{r}
susceptible = ggplot(sim, aes(x = time, y = S, color = time)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) 

infectious = ggplot(sim, aes(x = time, y = I, color = time)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6)
```

```{r}
susceptible + infectious
```


# Part 2: Simple analyses of model outputs
Convert the simulated numbers (#S, #I, #cumI etc.) to fraction relative to the population size

```{r}
percent_S = S0/N
percent_I= I0/N
percent_cumI = I0/N

percent_state = c(S = percent_S, I = percent_I, cumI = percent_cumI)
percent_sim = ode(y = percent_state, times = times, func = SIR, parms = parameters)
```

```{r}
percent_susceptible = ggplot(percent_sim, aes(x = time, y = percent_S, color = time)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) 

percent_infectious = ggplot(percent_sim, aes(x = time, y = percent_I, color = time)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6)
```

```{r}
percent_susceptible + percent_infectious
```


## Question 5
Based on the simulation, what is the population susceptibility (i.e. %S) at the end of simulation? What percentage of the population are infectious at the end of simulation? What percentage of the population have been infected by the end of simulation?

## Question 6
Plot the outputs %I and %S for each day during the simulated time period.


# Part 3: Simple analyses of model outputs
Aggregate the simulated daily outputs to weekly outputs. See model code in the script.

## Question 7
How many people are infected on Week 7?

## Question 8
Plot number of Susceptibles mid-week over time.

## Question 9
Plot number of infectious mid-week over time.

## Question 10
Plot number of New Infectious each week over time.
